# Create a Hash Table #

Let's create the basic functionality of a hash table. We've created a naive hashing function for you to use. You can pass a string value to the function hash and it will return a hashed value you can use as a key for storage. Store items based on this hashed value in the this.collection object. Create these three methods: add, remove, and lookup. The first should accept a key value pair to add to the hash table. The second should remove a key-value pair when passed a key. The third should accept a key and return the associated value or null if the key is not present.

Be sure to write your code to account for collisions!

Note: The remove method tests won't pass until the add and lookup methods are correctly implemented.
