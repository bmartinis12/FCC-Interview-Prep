# Insert an Element into a Max Heap #

Instructions: Here we will create a max heap. Start by just creating an insert method which adds elements to our heap. During insertion, it is important to always maintain the heap property. For a max heap this means the root element should always have the greatest value in the tree and all parent nodes should be greater than their children. For an array implementation of a heap, this is typically accomplished in three steps:

  - Add the new element to the end of the array.
  - If the element is larger than its parent, switch them.
  - Continue switching until the new element is either smaller than its parent or you reach the root of the tree.

Finally, add a print method which returns an array of all the items that have been added to the heap.
