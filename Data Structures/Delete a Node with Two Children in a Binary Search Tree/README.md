# Delete a Node with Two Children in a Binary Search Tree #

Let's finish our remove method by handling the third case. We've provided some code again for the first two cases. Add some code now to handle target nodes with two children. Any edge cases to be aware of? What if the tree has only three nodes? Once you are finished this will complete our deletion operation for binary search trees. Nice job, this is a pretty hard problem!
